In this project i'm going to research and build a project around machine learning.
At the time of creating this repository the concept is yet to be determined.
This is the initial readme.

dependencies:

ubuntu 16.04 LTS 
python2.7
pygame1.9.3
  SDL 1.2.15
  "Image" library: libsdl-image1.2-dev
  "Png" library: libpng12-0
  "Jpeg" library: libjpeg62-dev
  "Scrap" library: 

The game can be started with a terminal.
1. move to the directory "/Game".
2. start the game with "python Runner.py"
